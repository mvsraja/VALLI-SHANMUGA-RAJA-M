### ðŸš€ Projects
- **[Traffic Flow optimization](#)**  
  Optimized urban traffic management by predicting traffic conditions (Heavy, Normal, Low) using supervised machine learning. Evaluated and compared multiple algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), SVC, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree Classifier. The Decision Tree was selected for its superior accuracy in traffic prediction. The project aimed to reduce congestion and improve traffic signal control through data-driven insights, implemented using Google Colab for accessible development and testing.  

- **[Development of ADAS in EV](#)**  
  Engineered Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) for Electric Vehicles (EV), leveraging cutting-edge technologies to enhance safety and operational efficiency. Led end-to-end processes including design, implementation, and testing, ensuring seamless integration with EV platforms. Collaborated with cross-functional teams to deliver innovative solutions, addressing key challenges and optimizing performance in line with future automotive standards.  

- **[Trifled Drafter](#)**  
  Designed and developed the 'Trifled Drafter,' a compact and innovative solution to enhance portability for students. The project focused on reducing the length of the traditional mini drafter, enabling easier handling and transportation without compromising functionality. Demonstrated skills in design optimization and problem-solving to create a practical and user-friendly tool for academic use.  
  
- **[Jab File](#)**  
  Developed an innovative file system integrating an inbuilt punching machine for seamless document handling. Designed to streamline workflows, the system features a custom holder for punched papers, ensuring effortless organization and accessibility. This practical solution enhances productivity and efficiency, catering to both professional and personal organizational needs with a focus on convenience and functionality.
