### ðŸš€ Projects
- **[Traffic Flow optimization](#)**  
  Optimized urban traffic management by predicting traffic conditions (Heavy, Normal, Low) using supervised machine learning. Evaluated and compared multiple algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), SVC, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree Classifier. The Decision Tree was selected for its superior accuracy in traffic prediction. The project aimed to reduce congestion and improve traffic signal control through data-driven insights, implemented using Google Colab for accessible development and testing.  
  *Technologies:* Machine learning

- **[Development of ADAS in EV](#)**  
  Engineered Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) for Electric Vehicles (EV), leveraging cutting-edge technologies to enhance safety and operational efficiency. Led end-to-end processes including design, implementation, and testing, ensuring seamless integration with EV platforms. Collaborated with cross-functional teams to deliver innovative solutions, addressing key challenges and optimizing performance in line with future automotive standards.  
  *Technologies:* Python, Machine Learning, OpenFlow

- **[In-Cabin Monitoring System](#)**  
  Researching in-cabin monitoring systems using OpenCV for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS).  
  *Technologies:* OpenCV, Python
